# Tiger Moth CIX Mod (MSFS)

This is a mod to [Ant's Tiger Moth for MSFS](https://www.antsairplanes.com/msfstigermoth.html) to make some tweaks for CIX VFR Club.

The changes have been made so the plane more closely matches the performance of the Tiger Moth in FSX and XPlane and also some weather presets have been included.
