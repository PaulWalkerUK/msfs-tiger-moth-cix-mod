description="Tiger Moth HB-UPM. This Tiger Moth was licence-built at Rongotai, New Zealand and delivered to the RNZAF as NZ1455 in Nov 1942. Became ZK-ATM in Jun 1949 and used as a cropduster for several years. Crashed on take-off from Ardmore while towing a banner on 29 Sep 1967. It was repaired and restored as ZK-ATM in Aug 1971. Sold to the UK in May 1980 and registered as G-BJLI in Sep 1981, but it was cancelled on sale to Switzerland only two months later. It was finally registered as HB-UPM on 5 Apr 1982 and is now flown out of Sitterdorf in Germany by owner and pilot JÃ¼rgen Schott."
